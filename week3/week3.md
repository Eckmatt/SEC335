### Class Activity 3.1 - DNS Enumeration
This activity was interesting, and I found the ways to use nslookup to find dns records [cool](dns-resolver.sh). This took me most of my wednesday, as I tend to bash these assignments out in one go just before they're due. It might have ended up leading to some sloppy code, but the only thing that I really struggled with was using grep and awk. I'm still very new to these tools, and I had no idea where to even begin parsing the file when I was left to my own devices for deliverable 6. I had to look up how to grep for the IPv4 address format, and I didn't even really understand how the command I entered gave me that, but it seems to have worked. For the continuing this class, I'm probably gonna assign myself some extra grep practice so I don't get hung up like I did with deliverable 6.
