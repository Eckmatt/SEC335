# Week 2 Tech Journal


### Activity 2.1: Bash Refresher
Activity 2.1 is all about using some basic commands with bash. I'm pretty rusty with bash,
as the last time I used it was a little over a year ago, but it turns out I remembered
more than I thought, which allowed me to kind of brute force my way through the assignment.
Figuring out how to get the output of ping to spit itself correctly was the main problem I
ran into - it took me about an hour to realize that `"$?"` needed those double quotation marks.
Once I had solved that ping debacle, I found that nmap and fping were infinitely more
easier to use for these purposes then ping was in the first place, which is great to know.
