# Week 8 Tech Journal



### This Weeks Assignments


#### Lab 8.1: Weevely
This lab was really interesting and pretty quick to do. We reexamined pippin and took another more practical look at the exposed web server. I found a youtube video about Weevely that served as my tutorial for this lab, and it was really great and easy to follow, plus the whole thing is only 10 minutes long.

At first, the video confused me a bit because I for some reason tried to use ftp to access the backdoor script, but this did not work correctly. Once I remembered how I accessed the previous backdoor script, I used http and connected no problem, and got the required information easily.
