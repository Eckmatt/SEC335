# Assignment F.1: Home Pentesting Lab


### Deliverable 1
This assignment involved making a home lab for penetration testing, starting with the Kali box. For starters, I needed to set up the NAT anb VMNet 6,7,8 networks, with
with 192.168.229.0, 10.0.4.0, 10.0.5.0, 10.0.6.0 subnet ips respectively. I downloaded all the VM ISO's to my usb flash and used it to deploy the installer. I set the
box to NAT networking, and followed the Kali installer until it was set and ready to use.
