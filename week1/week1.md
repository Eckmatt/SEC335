# Week 1 Tech Journal

### This Weeks Assignments
This week was a refresher  - getting re-introduced to class as well as tech journaling. I've started using Obsidian recently and I really like it, 
so I'm deciding to use more markdown files for writing and presenting text and notes.
For this week, we had to setup our Kali box as well as a written assignment. Chrome desktop wasn't working well, but my computer can already access vSphere without
the VPN or viewportal, so I'm not too concerned about it.
